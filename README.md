# Investment Portfolio Report
The following report has a dual purpose of (1) providing the portfolio's owner a detailed account of investment performance in a format not always available to investors on trading platforms and (2) illustrating how the analyses and visualizations in the report can be created in an automated fashion using RMarkdown functionality.

A version of the investment report can be [viewed on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/jferrara/investment-report).
